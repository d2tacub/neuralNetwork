# neuralNetwork
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for regression tasks. The neural network is built from scratch in Python, demonstrating the fundamentals of how neural networks operate without relying on high-level machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. This project uses NumPy for numerical operations.

Brief
The neural network is designed to predict continuous values for regression problems. The implementation involves manual development of the key components of a neural network, including forward propagation, backward propagation, gradient computation, and parameter updates. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function.

Data Description

Input Data: Randomly generated numerical data representing one feature.

Output Data: Continuous target values calculated based on a linear relationship with added noise.

Dataset Properties:

Input: 500 examples, each with 1 feature.

Target: Continuous values calculated using the formula: , where  is random Gaussian noise.

Approach

Network Design:

Input Layer: 1 neuron (for the single feature).

Hidden Layer: 10 neurons using ReLU activation.

Output Layer: 1 neuron with linear activation for regression output.

Implementation Details:

Parameter Initialization: Random initialization of weights and biases for each layer.

Forward Propagation: Computation of activations through the layers, using ReLU for hidden layers and a linear output.

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the error between predicted and actual target values.

Backward Propagation: Gradient computation using the chain rule for parameter optimization.

Parameter Updates: Updating weights and biases using gradient descent.

Training:

The model is trained iteratively over a specified number of epochs, with the cost computed at each iteration to monitor convergence.

Questions for Analysis

Can a manually implemented neural network learn and predict a simple linear regression relationship?

How does the network’s performance vary with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden units)?

What insights can be drawn about the underlying relationship between input and output data?

Results

Performance: The network effectively learns the linear relationship, achieving a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) after training.

Cost Trend: The cost steadily decreases during training, reflecting successful optimization.

Predictions: The predicted outputs closely align with the true target values, demonstrating accurate regression.

Insights

The neural network successfully models the linear relationship, even with noisy data.

The use of ReLU activation in hidden layers helps in modeling potential non-linear features, though it’s not essential for this task.

Careful tuning of learning rate and weight initialization is crucial for convergence and stability.

Recommendations

Scalability: Extend this implementation to handle more complex datasets with multiple features and examples.

Regularization: Add techniques such as L2 regularization or dropout to improve generalization on larger datasets.

Advanced Architectures: Incorporate additional hidden layers or neurons for more complex regression tasks.

Optimization Algorithms: Experiment with optimization algorithms like Adam or RMSprop for faster convergence.

Performance Benchmarking: Compare this custom implementation with high-level libraries to evaluate performance and computational efficiency.
